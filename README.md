# TeCS-2-Dictionary
* Code for learning the Color, Shape, Texture and Symmetry Dictionaries.
* We have also added the synthetic datasets we generated along with DTD[1].
* Along with the datasets we have also included the learnt dictionaries. Using transform.py, a large numpy array for a dataset can be converted to the sparse dictionary learning based representation which can be used for recognition tasks.
* We used an off the shelf DenseNet classfiier code which is easily availabel in multiple deep learning libraries.
